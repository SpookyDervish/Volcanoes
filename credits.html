            <p>These are the <b>amazing</b> people that helped make this project possible! Please show them love as they
                are kind and deserving people.</p>
            <p>This project was made over the span of a few weeks. We started with researching and creating our team.
                The process of trial and error was annoying but still fun as we knew we were getting somewhere. This
                project was made for a science project on tectonic-plate-caused nautral disasters.</p>
