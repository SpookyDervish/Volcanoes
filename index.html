            <h1>Volcanoes</h1>
            <h2>How it all Starts</h2>
            <p>The first thing that happens to cause a volcanic eruption is the Earth's mantle. The mantle contains
                molten lava. The Earth has many pieces, like in a puzzle. They are called tectonic plates.</p>
            <img src="images/diagram-1.png" alt="A diagram showing the tectonic plates moving.">
            <figcaption>A diagram showing the tectonic plates moving.</figcaption>
            <h2>Why Volcanoes Erupt</h2>
            <p>Events such as tectoic plate movement or a related event such as a tsunami, lava from the mantle
                gradually rises into the cracks in the tectonic plates.
                This pressure builds up in the holes and emerges into the primary vent of a volcano. Volcanoes have one
                or more vents in them where lava can escape. Boom! Lava bursts out from the volcano's primary and
                secondary vents.</p>

                volcano.</figcaption>
            <h2>During The Eruption</h2>
            <p>During an eruption, smoke flows out, beach sand turns into a dark shade, the Volcano spews out large
                amounts of lava and rock that cause death and destruction. </p>
            <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
            <p>After an eruption, roofs on buildings may collapse and kill people if enough volcanic ash particles land
                on them. People can develop breathing problems, throat irritation and other respiratory issues when ash
                falls after a volcanic eruption. Volcanoes are destructive and horrific but also fascinating. Examples
                like Krakatau, Mont Pel√©e, and many more are some of the most dangerous volcanoes. When a volcano
                reaches a certain threshold, it is named a supervolcano. Super volcanoes are some of the most
                destructive things on our mother planet Earth.</p>
            <p>Depending on the neighboring towns and cities reaction time, evacuations may commense and civiliansmay be
                forced to leave their homes and families. Damages are usually in the thousands to billions depending on
                the size of nearby populations.</p>

            <h2>The Safety Precautions in Place</h2>
            <p>In some countries with volcanic activities such as Papua New Guinea, it has a detection system on the
                volcano to send feedback to a nearby town which then sends it out to everyone. Some countries have
                experienced volcanoes so many times they just know when to leave their homes. </p>
